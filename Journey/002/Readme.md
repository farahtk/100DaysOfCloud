# Day 2 - Registering Domain and deploying React App to AWS

## Introduction
Deplying the React App to AWS and getting understanding of the AWS docs and console. 


## Prerequisite

Day 1 tasks complete with Github template setup and React app ready to be deployed. 

## Cloud Research

- Registering Domain with AWS using Route 53. Could not find .dev in AWS domain registration. Used namecheap instead. 
- Looked at different [Website hosting options in AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/websites/). React App deployment with some learning for Backend needed AWS Aplify. Went ahead with setting that up. 

## Try yourself

### Step 2 — Deploy React App

- [Set up AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/hosting/)
- Connect Github repo to Amplify
- Confirm your build commands are correct
- Build and Deploy

### Step 3 — Confirm your App is successfully running
- USe your app link in the AWS Amplify console

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome
